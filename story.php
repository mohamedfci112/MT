            Mariam Al Bossery is a fashion brand that offers sustainable and versatile clothing for women who
             want to express their individuality and creativity. The brand's designs are inspired by the Victorian
              era and other ancient times, but with a modern twist. The founder and designer, Mariam Al Bossery,
               was born in Cairo and graduated from IFA in Paris in 2019. <br> She has always had a passion for
                fashion and art, and she decided to follow her dream of becoming a designer. She blends her cultural
                 heritage and her cosmopolitan experience to create unique and elegant designs that reflect her
                  personality and vision. Mariam believes that women should not be limited by society's expectations,
                   but rather encouraged to be themselves and pursue their dreams.
